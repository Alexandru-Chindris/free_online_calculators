# Free Online Calculators

This repository contains a website that provide a number of useful tools.
The website is done with Vanilla HMTL, CSS and Javascript.
The website was developed to put the knowledge studied in practice. I do not believe it is useful to use this 
site to do routine calculations with a calculator or to compute a discount, those tools are now easily available in our cell phones.
